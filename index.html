                     and Space Technology, 1988 (Written with Roddam Narasimha) and Turning Points (2012).<br><br>

                <h3>Autography</h3> 
                <p> The best thing that one can find in Dr. Kalam's work is its simplicity. He never tried to compel his readers to mug-up philosophical or technical terms or research findings. Instead, he emphasized more on the lifetime experiences, natural incidences, successes and most importantly, failures. All of his work 
                    tried to open the gates of the spirit and the mind of the reader to judge the emptiness inside and conduct a self study and assessment to aspire.</p>
